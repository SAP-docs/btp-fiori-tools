# Basic Template

The basic template is intended for all developers who want to start developing their own SAPUI5 app from scratch.

With this basic template you have a blank canvas to start coding right away. The basic file structure is set up according to our best practices.

> ### Note:  
> This template does not include SAP Fiori launchpad features and is intended for standalone use. If you want to convert it to a launchpad app you have to add some features manually, such as the *Save as Tile* feature.

The `index.html` file defines the page that is displayed when the app is started. It is located in the `webapp` folder. It contains an XML view with a header and a title from the `sap.m` library as a starting point. You can easily modify the app to add more functionality.

An important best practice is to have unit and integration tests for your app. With this template, we have included sample tests that you can use: Tests on formatters and the app controller are the basic tests any app should cover. You can find them in the `test` subfolder of the `webapp` folder.
