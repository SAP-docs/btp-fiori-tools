# Supported Templates

This is a list of supported templates that enable you to create freestyle SAPUI5 applications.

-   *Basic*

    The [Basic Template](basic-template-14fdcc0.md) is intended for those developers who want to create their SAPUI5 app from scratch. With this basic template, a blank canvas is available to start coding right away. The basic file structure is set up according to our best practices.

-   *Custom Page*

    Create an SAP Fiori elements application containing a custom page based on the flexible programming model. With this custom page template, you can add the Page building block as a default layout. For more information, see [Flexible Programming Model](https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/overview/introduction).


> ### Caution:  
> SAP Fiori tools supports the development of SAP Fiori elements and freestyle SAPUI5 applications with a minimum SAPUI5 version of 1.65 or higher.
