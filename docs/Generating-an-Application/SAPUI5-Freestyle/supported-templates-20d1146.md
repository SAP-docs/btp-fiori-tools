# Supported Templates

This is a list of supported templates that enable you to create SAP Fiori freestyle applications.

-   *Basic*

    The [Basic Template](basic-template-14fdcc0.md) is intended for those developers who want to create their SAPUI5 app from scratch. With this basic template, a blank canvas is available to start coding right away. The basic file structure is set up according to our best practices.

-   *SAP Fiori Worklist Application*

    The **[Worklist Template](worklist-template-dcd9f97.md)** template implements a typical worklist template, one of the patterns that is specified by the [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/).

    A worklist displays a collection of items to be processed by the user and usually involves reviewing details of a list item and taking action. If the data needs to be organized into columns or the overview of the items is more important than displaying the item details directly, this template can be used as a starting point.

-   *SAP Fiori List-Detail Application*

    The **[List-Detail Template](list-detail-template-c3e3ecd.md)** template implements a flexible column layout, one of the design patterns that is specified by the [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/).

    The flexible column layout is a layout control that displays multiple templates on a single page. This ensures faster and more fluid navigation between multiple templates than the usual page-by-page navigation. The flexible column layout offers different layouts with up to three columns. In the template, two columns can be used, which are list and detail.

    > ### Caution:  
    > The SAP Fiori Worklist and SAP Fiori List-Detail freestyle templates are deprecated. Itâ€™s recommended to use the Custom page SAP Fiori template based on the flexible programming model as an alternative.

    > ### Caution:  
    > Currently, SAP Fiori tools support the development of SAP Fiori elements and SAP Fiori freestyle applications with minimum SAPUI5 versions 1.65 or higher.
