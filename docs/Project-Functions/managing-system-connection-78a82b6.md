# Managing System Connection

SAP Fiori tools running in VS Code enable to save the connection information to a remote system. This functionality provides faster authentication while creating an application, generating deployment configuration, and deploying an application. The credentials are saved in the operating system secured storage, such as Credential Manager in Windows and Keychain in Mac.
