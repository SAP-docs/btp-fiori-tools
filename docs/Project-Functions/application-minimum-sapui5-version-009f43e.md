# Application Minimum SAPUI5 Version

The minimum SAPUI5 version declares the version, which is required at runtime to support all the features used in application development. If the target system for deployment doesnâ€™t have the required minimum, the [deployed application](../Deploying-an-Application/deploying-an-application-1b7a3be.md) in SAP Fiori tools shows a warning. The version must be defined by the developer. This can be done during generation when selecting a version for the project. Later changes can be done with the command `Fiori: Change Minimum SAPUI5 Version`.

The application's minimum version is also used to determine which corresponding version of [@sap/ux-specification](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/ux-specification) is installed along the project to provide the matching feature set in application modeler and guided development.
