# Application Information

When your SAP Fiori elements project is generated, an **Application Information** page will launch automatically. The page consists of four sections:

-   **Project Detail** provides information about the project, such as project type, SAPUI5 version, backend, and pages that are part of the application. Click the <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î„†</span> \(*Page*\) icon to launch [Configure Page Elements](../Developing-an-Application/configure-page-elements-047507c.md).

-   **Status** provides a summary of the project dependencies with links to fix any issues.
-   **What you can do** provides quick links to the SAP Fiori tools commands that are relevant to the project.
-   **What you can learn** links to various help topics including how to contact support.

You can relaunch the **Application Information** page at any time by executing the *Fiori: Open Application Info* command. In addition, you can also run [Project Validation](project-validation-6f3c737.md) at any time after generating your project.
