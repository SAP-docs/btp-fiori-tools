# Upgrade Safe Compatibility Rules



<a name="loio53706e2ca58240a789ecf6a324152513__section_jqz_xzb_d1c"/>

## Overview

SAPUI5 Flexibility ensures a modification-free extensibility approach by separating extension code from the original application life cycle. However, applications may change their UI implementation details and enhance their service implementation compatibly during the upgrade. Developing controller extensions along this guideline will prevent breaking extensions after the upgrade of the base application or reduce effort to adapt to potential changes on UI level.

> ### Note:  
> To comply with automatic upgrades in Cloud, an Adaptation project deployed to S/4HANA Cloud system will contain a runnable snapshot of the base application containing all UI artefacts as well as a local copy of all UI annotations. Once the base application is upgraded, the snapshot will ensure that the extended application is still runnable even in case of conflicts between extension coding and new UI implementation details. Those conflicts should be solved, and a new version of Adaptation project has to be deployed to benefit from the upgraded version as well as to receive further support for the base app functionality in the extension case.

To check whether the base app of an adaptation project is up-to-date, see [Check Whether Your Adaptation Project Is Up-To-Date with Base App Upgrades](check-whether-your-adaptation-project-is-up-to-date-with-base-app-upgrades-c6ef105.md).

## Rules for Controller Extensions

-   Follow the general [Best Practices for Developers](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/28fcd55b04654977b63dacbee0552712).

-   Only access controls with stable IDs, never rely on the order of controls in the aggregations or parent-child chain.
-   Always check that a control you are accessing exists and that it is of an expected control type before calling any further methods of the control.

    This applies also for controls added via adaptation project, which might have been added by [Add Fragments to an Aggregation or Extension Point](add-fragments-to-an-aggregation-or-extension-point-6033d56.md) changes or via controller coding.

-   Don't call or override any private or protected methods of SAPUI5 app coding.
-   Donâ€™t use any deprecated SAPUI5 artifacts \(controls, properties, methods, or other\).
-   Value helps are not part of the SAP internal stability contract \(for example, they might change after an upgrade\). Do not use value help entity sets in the controller coding and for data binding of controls in XML fragments.
-   For SAP Fiori elements-based applications, follow the guide [Extending Delivered Apps Using Adaptation Extension](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/52fc48b479314d0688be24f699778c47).
-   Reuse components might change, always write resilient coding when accessing any functionality of a reuse component to handle unexpected errors and failures gracefully.
-   The OData metadata can change during the app upgrade, so don't hard code against any property values.
