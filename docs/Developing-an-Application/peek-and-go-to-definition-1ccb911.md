# Peek and Go to Definition

Peek Definition lets you preview and update the referenced annotation without switching away from the code that you’re writing. It’s triggered when your cursor is inside the referenced annotation value.

-   Using the keyboard: press [Alt F12\] \(Win\), [Option F12\] \(Mac\)
-   Using the mouse: right-click and select `Peek Definition`

If an annotation is defined in multiple sources, all these sources are listed. You can select which one you would like to view or update. Annotation layering isn’t considered.





### Go to Definition

Go To Definition lets you navigate to the source of the referenced annotation and opens the source file scrolled to the respective place in a new tab. It’s triggered when your cursor is inside the referenced annotation value.

Place your text cursor inside the path referencing the annotation term segment or translatable string value and trigger Go to Definition:

-   Using the keyboard: press [F12\] in VS Code, [Ctrl\] + [F11\]  in SAP Business Application Studio

-   Using the mouse: right-click and select *Go To Definition*

-   Using the keyboard and mouse: [Ctrl\] + mouse click \(Win\), [CMD\] + mouse click \(Mac\)


If an annotation is defined in multiple sources, Peek definition listing these sources will be shown instead. Annotation layering isn’t considered.
