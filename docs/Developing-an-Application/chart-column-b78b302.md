## Moving Chart Column

To move a column within a table, use one of the following options:

-   **Drag and Drop**

    Hover over the table column outline, press and hold the mouse button while moving the mouse pointer to the different position within the table. Release the mouse button at the desired position. Eligible positions are highlighted in green.

    With drag and drop, you can move multiple columns at once by pressing [CTRL\] + [\+\]  .

-   **Arrow Icons**

    Click the <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î‡¡</span>\(*Move Up*\) or <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(*Move Down*\) icon next to the column name. This option only moves one column at a time.

## Sorting Micro Charts in Chart Columns

Sorting micro charts in chart columns is set in the *Sort Order* property of the chart column. This property is only visible if you have the *Presentation Variant* property defined for the micro chart column. This requires SAPUI5 version 1.130 or higher defined as the `minUI5Version` in the `manifest.json` file. You can only sort chart data in micro charts that are area, line, column, or comparison type.



### Presentation Variant

The *Presentation Variant* property shows the `UI.PresentationVariant` annotation that defines the micro chart column's sorting options. To view the sorting properties, you must set the *Presentation Variant: Annotation* to *New*.

When the *Presentation Variant: Annotation* is set, you can define one or more direct properties of the entity by which to sort the chart column. Under *Presentation Variant: Sort Order*, click *Add Sort Property*. A new table row for the sort property is added with *Property* and *Direction* fields. Choose a property and direction to sort by to update the sorting logic for your micro chart column.

If you have multiple sort properties, you can define in which order they apply by moving them up and down within the sort property.

You can remove the reference to the `UI.PresentationVariant` annotation generated by the *Page Editor* by setting the *Presentation Variant: Annotation* to *None*.

To remove unreferenced `UI.PresentationVariant` annotations generated by the *Page Editor* from the annotation file, run the cleanup procedure. This also removes the other unreferenced `UI.PresentationVariant` annotations defined with qualifiers to keep your annotation file as clean as possible.
