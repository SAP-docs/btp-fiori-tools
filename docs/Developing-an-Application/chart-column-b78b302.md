## Adding a Chart Column

To add a chart column to a table to a section, perform the following steps:

1.  Click *Add Chart Column* when clicking the :heavy_plus_sign: \(*Add*\) icon in the Columns node in the *Page Editor* .

    > ### Note:  
    > The *Add Chart Column* option is disabled if the table entity does not have any numeric properties.

    > ### Note:  
    > Depending on the selected chart type, fill in additional properties as described below.

3.  Click *Add*. Depending on the desired chart type, you need to choose values for the mandatory properties.
    -   When the chart column is added, a new `UI.Chart` and `UI.DataPoint` annotation is created.


Column properties can be configured in the *Property Panel*.

For information on defining and editing the properties, see [Column Properties](table-columns-a80d603.md#loioa80d603f85164482b192eeeb2df535a2__columnproperties) and [Appendix](appendix-457f2e9.md#loio457f2e9699b5437fb09d56311055a4a0).

## Maintaining Chart Column Properties

In addition to the column properties available for all column types, you can define the following properties specific to the chart column:

-   Maximum Value Type
    -   Choose the expression type for the maximum possible value in the chart. It could be a decimal number or a property of type decimal.

-   Maximum Value
    -   Choose a decimal number representing the maximum possible value in the chart.

-   Minimum Value Type
    -   Choose the expression type for the starting value of the chart. It could be a decimal number or a property of type decimal.

-   Minimum Value
    -   Choose a decimal number representing the starting value for the chart.

-   Forecast Value
    -   Choose a property representing the expected value.

-   Target Value
    -   Choose a property representing the target value.

-   Measures
    -   Add properties representing values for additional lines.

-   Criticality Source
    -   Choose how the chart color should be calculated. Choose Property if criticality calculation is performed in the back end and exposed as a service entity element. Choose Calculation to define the criticality calculation parameters, such as improvement direction and deviation ranges. Note: For some chart types, only one option is possible. For example, the criticality can be set either only as a property or only as calculation.
