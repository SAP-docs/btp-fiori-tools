# Visualizing Annotations with Service Modeler

You can view backend annotations in the SAP Fiori tools - Service Modeler, and maintain them with [XML Code Editor](maintaining-annotations-with-language-server-6fc93f8.md#loio6fc93f80827940809437365abdf85b75__XML_Code_Editor).

Only OData service and CAP service annotations are supported. Annotations are associated to: projections, entities, and properties and are identified by the annotation icon ![](../Project-Functions/images/FIORI_TOOLS_SERVICE_MODELER_ANNOTATIONS_ICON_249d281.png) in the entity or projection detail panel, or on the entity or projection node in the *Expanded View* and *List View*.

You can view the annotations associated to an entity, projection, or properties displayed in the Service Modeler *Annotation List View*.

For OData service, the Annotation *List View* displays the annotations associated to the target entity in both the backend and local annotations files. The annotation terms defined in the local annotation file win over the same annotation with the same qualifier and applied to the same target in the backend sources. Backend annotations canâ€™t be edited via the SAP Fiori tools - Service Modeler tool but backend annotations can be overridden in the local annotation file and edited manually via a **text editor** or using the [XML Code Editor](maintaining-annotations-with-language-server-6fc93f8.md#loio6fc93f80827940809437365abdf85b75__XML_Code_Editor). The local annotations file is located: `/webapp/annotations/<filename>.xml`, see [XML Code Editor](maintaining-annotations-with-language-server-6fc93f8.md#loio6fc93f80827940809437365abdf85b75__XML_Code_Editor) for more information about how to work with local annotations.
