# Request a New Guide

The guides available in the guided development extension present the most commonly used features. There are also many more features available to the SAP Fiori elements developer. For that reason, guided development also allows you to submit a request for a guide.

You can request a new guide by using one of the following options:

-   Scroll to the bottom of the guides list and click *Request Guide* in the “Request new guide” section.
-   Enter *request guide* to the “Search guides” field.
-   Navigate your pointer to the Help icon and select *Request New Guide* from the drop-down list.

How to use the **Request Guide** form:

1.  Fill in your name, email, title for a new guide, and description of what you need.
2.  Click *Submit*.
3.  When an email client opens, check your message and click *Send*.
