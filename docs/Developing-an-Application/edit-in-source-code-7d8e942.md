# Edit in Source Code

With the **edit in source code** feature, the user can navigate to the code fragments in the annotation file where the related annotation is defined.

## How to Use the Feature

To find the [Edit in source code\] button in the property panel for editable and noneditable properties, locate the annotation tag, and click on the ![](images/FIORI_TOOLS_EDITINSOURCE_342cf09.jpg) \(*Edit in source code*\) button next to the text field. If multiple definitions are present, a pop-up window with the options appears, and you can click a particular file to see the definition.

> ### Note:  
> Multiple definitions pop-up window is only available in VS Code. Only first annotation is shown in SAP Business Application Studio.

> ### Note:  
> There can be more than one way to configure a UI feature on the Fiori elements-based application. Some ways will be too complex for *Page Editor* to interpret. In those cases, the respective field control \(dropdown, input field\), including [Edit in source code\] button isnâ€™t rendered in the properties panel. Instead, the link *edit in source code* is displayed with the same functionality as a button. You can then use this link to edit the property directly in the code.
