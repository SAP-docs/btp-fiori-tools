# Navigation to References

XML annotation language server lets you check where your annotations and metadata elements are referenced within the codebase. For example, if your annotation or metadata file contains `UI.LineItem` annotation, you can check if and in which other annotations such as `UI.Facets` itâ€™s referenced.

Similarly, you can check if a specific metadata element, such as entity type, property, and action is used within the annotation values or whether any annotations are applied to it.

Checking the references before making any changes to annotations or metadata elements gives you an overview of the potential impact of these changes.
