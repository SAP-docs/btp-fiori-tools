# Maintaining Building Blocks

The *Page Editor* supports adding and maintaining properties of SAP Fiori elements building blocks for OData V4-based applications. For more information about building blocks, see [Building Block Overview](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/buildingBlocks/buildingBlockOverview).

The *Page Editor* supports adding custom pages and custom sections to an object page.

You can create the following building blocks using the *Page Editor* which you can add to a custom page or section:

-   *Chart*
-   *Filter Bar*
-   *Table*
-   *Page* \(custom page only\)

The following screenshot shows a custom page with the Page building block:
