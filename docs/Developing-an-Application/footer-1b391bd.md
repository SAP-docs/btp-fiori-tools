# Footer

**Actions**

Actions are displayed in Footer as buttons. Header actions are based on the `UI.DataFieldForAction` records with `Determining` property set to `true` in `UI.Identification` annotation that is applied to the main entity.

> ### Note:  
> External navigation actions cannot be set in the footer, irrespective of the `Determining` value.

You can add, delete and maintain the footer actions same as the actions based on `UI.DataFieldForAction` described in the [Table Actions](table-actions-da1931b.md) section.

> ### Note:  
> Properties applicable only to action columns \(e.g. *Importance*\) are not relevant and therefore not provided for footer actions.

You can move actions from the footer to the page header and to the form sections based on the main entity of the page.
