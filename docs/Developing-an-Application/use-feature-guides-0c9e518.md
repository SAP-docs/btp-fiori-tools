# Use Feature Guides

With guided development, you can access **how-to** guides and tutorials that explain how to implement certain functionality in an SAP Fiori elements application. You can read through the steps required to implement a feature and then use the guided development approach to make the required changes in your project.

## Launching Guided Development

You can launch guided development in the following ways:



### Using Command Palette

-   Open *Command Palette* \([CMD\]/[CTRL\] + [Shift\] + [P\]\).
-   Start typing *guided development*.
-   Select *Fiori: Open Guided Development* or *Fiori: Open Guided Development to the Side*.
-   Select SAP Fiori elements project from your workspace.

The *Fiori: Open Guided Development* option opens guided development in a new tab. The *Fiori: Open Guided Development to the Side* option opens guided development to the side of the current file in another column.



### Using folder context menu

If you already have a SAP Fiori elements project in your current workspace, you can right-click its folder and select *SAP Fiori tools - Open Guided Development*. Then, guided development opens to the side of the current file in another column.

> ### Note:  
> If you don’t have any SAP Fiori elements project in your workspace, you can still open guided development by using *Command Palette*. It’s possible to check the available guides descriptions and code samples, while interactive features are disabled in this case.



### Working with projects

Guided development can only work with one project at a time. The name of this project is displayed on the tab header next to guided development, and this project provides all project-specific data used in the guides.

The project-specific data contains the following components:

-   The list of entities in the *Entity* list.

-   The list of data sources in the *Model* list.

-   The list of pages in the *Page* list.

-   The annotation terms that are defined in the service across all the guides.

    > ### Note:  
    > In guided development, you can add annotations from services other than the mainService.


**To select or change a project.**

1.  Click *Select Project* on the left side of the toolbar.
2.  Select a project from the *Project* list.

## Accessibility

You can navigate to guided development with either a mouse or a keyboard. Keyboard navigation provides a streamlined experience, allowing users to find and use guides without needing to use their mouse. Use the arrow keys to navigate within sections, the `Tab` key to navigate to new sections and controls, `Shift + Tab` to navigate back to sections and controls, and `Enter` to make selections.

Guided development supports the use of high contrast themes.
