# Adding Local Annotation Files

This guide describes how to add annotation files to an adaptation project without tooling support.



## Procedure

1.  Right click the `manifest.appdescr_variant` file of your adaptation project and select the *Adaptation Project* \> *Add Local Annotation File*.

2.  After the wizard starts, you may be asked to enter the credentials for the system that you created your adaptation project.

3.  From the *Target OData Service* dropdown, choose to which service from the manifest of the base application you want to add annotation file.

4.  Choose if you want to create an empty annotation file that you can edit later or to select already existing annotation file from a workspace.

5.  Click *Finish* to save your changes.
