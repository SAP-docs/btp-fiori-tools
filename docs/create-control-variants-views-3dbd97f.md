# Create Control Variants \(Views\)



<a name="loio3dbd97f940564b11a8b7baf1e08aa88e__prereq_lg3_hty_hkb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   To use the `sap.ui.fl.variants.VariantManagement` the minimum SAPUI5 version installed on the system is 1.73.

    Make sure that you have enabled your application for UI adaptation and have the `sap.ui.fl.variants.VariantManagement` control as part of the page \(XML view\) that is going to be adapted. For more information, see [SAPUI5 Flexibility: Enable Your App for UI Adaptation](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/f1430c0337534d469da3a56307ff76af) and the `sap.ui.fl.variants.VariantManagement` [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.fl.variants.VariantManagement).

-   To use the `sap.ui.comp.smartvariants.SmartVariantManagement` the minimum SAPUI5 version installed on the system is 1.90. For more information, see `sap.ui.comp.smartvariants.SmartVariantManagement` [API Reference](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.comp.smartvariants.SmartVariantManagement).

## Context

The Adaptation Editor allows you to create, load, change, and save control variants. Typically, you would create variants of a control to give different options for the end user for better usability in special use cases when they might need \(or not\) a specific part of control.

> ### Note:  
> You can define variants for specific controls on the user interface. Have in mind that variants are also called "views", usually in a more nontechnical context, for example, on the user interface.

## Procedure

Creating and adapting control variants \(views\) is done the same way, as in the key user scenario. You can follow the procedure described in [Creating and Adapting Views](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4fc8d03390c342da8a60f8ee387bca1a/latest/en-US/91ae3492323b42a79ca66fbfaf5af3f9.html) . The only difference from the key user scenario is that you do not have to publish your changes. They are saved as an ordinary change in your adaptation project, in the same manner as all other changes.
