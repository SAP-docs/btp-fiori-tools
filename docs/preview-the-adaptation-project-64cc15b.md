# Preview the Adaptation Project

You can preview the adaptation project in a new browser tab.



## Context

Expand the *webapp* folder from your workspace, right-click the `manifest.appdescr_variant` file, and choose *Open Preview*. You will be asked to allow popup windows, as this will trigger opening another browser tab â€“ you should allow popups in this case.

\(Optional\) Depending on your authentication model you might be asked to enter credentials for the system you are trying to reach. If this is the case, provide your credentials.

The adaptation project will then be loaded in this separate browser tab. It is fully functional, you can navigate in it, load data, or test your newly added functionality.
