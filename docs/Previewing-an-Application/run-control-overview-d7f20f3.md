# Run Control Overview

The *Run Configuration* dialog looks for the `<workspace_root>/.vscode/launch.json` file, but it will not traverse into any subfolders so it will not find any configurations inside `launch.json` files that reside in nested folders. You can merge configurations from multiple`launch.json` files by using workspaces. Here is a sample that shows different development environment setups.

## Example

Assuming the following file system structure:

![](images/RunConfig_Image1_5cfcf01.png)

The `launch.json` files contain the configuration noted next to them: **Config One**, **Config Two**, and**Config Subfolder**. Iepending on which folder you choose, you will get different results.

When opening Folder\_One, Config One is shown in *Run and Debug* view.

If you open Folder Two, the *Run and Debug* view shows Config Two.

> ### Note:  
> The config from Subfolder is not shown because the`launch.json` configuration file cannot be found in the `<workspace_root>/.vscode` file.

When you open Subfolder in your development environment, only Config Subfolder is shown.

In addition, you can create a workspace, by opening one of the folders and selecting *Add Folder to Workspace* in your development environment. The workspace can be configured in many ways. Here are some examples:

-   **workspace root:** Folder\_One

    Only **Config One** is displayed, same as shown above in Open Folder\_One.

-   **workspace roots**: Folder\_One, Folder\_Two

    ![](images/Runconfig_Image5_7d410a4.png)

    In this case, Config One and Config Two are displayed, because these two configurations can be found in `Folder_One/.vscode/launch.json` and `Folder_Two/.vscode/launch.json`

-   **workspace roots**: Folder\_One, Folder\_Two, Subfolder

    ![](images/Runconfig_Image7_9d494db.png)

    In this case configurations from all three `launch.json` files are displayed:

> ### Note:  
> As seen in the last example, you can add a subfolder of an existing workspace root folder as a standalone workspace root.
