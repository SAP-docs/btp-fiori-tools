<a name="loio580887790be14634a44f620127dbeb5e__prereq_hd2_g2g_wtb"/>

You have already deployed the adaptation project in question to an on-premise system following the procedure described in [Deploy the Adaptation Project to the ABAP Repository](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/developing-sap-fiori-app-in-sap-business-application-studio/deploy-adaptation-project?locale=en-US). The technical requirements for the update action are the same as these for the deploy.



## Context

## Procedure

1.  Right-click on main folder, the `webapp` folder, or the `manifest.appdescr_variant` file and select *Open Deployment Wizard*.

2.  Choose which system you want to deploy the project to. The system that you have used for the creation of the project is selected by default.

3.  If the project that you have selected has been already deployed to that system \(it is eligible for update\) you will be asked what action would you like to perform â€“ *Update* or *Undeploy*. Choose *Update*.

4.  Choose `Next`, to start the deployment process.
