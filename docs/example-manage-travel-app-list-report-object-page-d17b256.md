> ### Sample Code:  
> Markdown
> 
> ```
> I want to create a travel application that shows a list of trips taken by employees.
> 
> The list of trips should include the following details:
> 
> ![Alt Text](Travel_List.jpeg)
> 
> Each trip can have many bookings and multiple notes. On the travel details page, the app should show:
> 
> ![Alt Text](Travel_Details.jpeg)
> 
> The total trip price should equal the price of all the bookings for that trip. If there are no bookings for a trip, the total trip price should be zero.
> 
> If there are any bookings associated with a trip, then each booking must cost more than zero.
> 
> Clicking on a booking should allow the user to see more details.
